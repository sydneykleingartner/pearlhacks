      Even through there are so many careers and fields in STEM, we compiled a list of the most common disciplines found in engineering schools. Under each section, there is a description of each field- what it is about, what you are going to learn, and what those engineers do. Then there is a link to open source journals and  current research in the field, so you can keep up to date on and stay informed. Lastly, there is a link to related potential opportunities and jobs in the area so you can start exploring different career opportunities.
