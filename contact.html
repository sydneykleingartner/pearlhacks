          <p>“I had never met a female engineer or computer scientist before walking onto my college’s campus. Since I had never known one, I doubted my ability to be one and felt like the odds were stacked against me. I remember crying as I tried to understand methods and for loops, certain that I was just too dumb to understand what I believed everyone else understood instantly. Through a lot of late nights and a few tears, I now know myself to be capable of whatever I put my mind to, and I understand the value of persistence, even when difficulties arise. We will only move forward as a society when we bring all hands on deck- and that means all hands, no matter the race, gender, socioeconomic class, religion, or background we come from. Being a woman in computer science is difficult, but with STEM, I have an amazing opportunity to move the world towards how I envision it to be.” -Sydney

            “I learned about the struggles that came with being a female engineer, and specifically computer scientist, from an incredibly young age. I grew up in Silicon Valley, with my father in the technology industry, and he was sure to inform me of both the negatives and the positives of the high-tech work environment. In Silicon Valley and beyond, my father made sure I knew that men can bluff through things that women cannot, and that any woman in the industry would be disproportionately questioned and doubted, and would therefore need to be much more hard-working and competent than her peers. As much as this reality is disappointing and truly unfair, I am thankful that my father shared with it with me- I am now set on changing it. I want to return to Silicon Valley after college, and I am excited about the possibilities that can come when we work to overcome stereotypes and make STEM a field anyone can enter and succeed in. How I see it- if Silicon Valley is a bunch of overgrown teenage boys playing ping pong and eating nachos, then hand me a paddle- I’m ready to serve.” -Tuhina

            “The small town I grew up in, flush with evergreen trees and a roaring river, was not exactly a haven for STEM education. Coming from rural Washington State, I was always the only girl in any kind of advanced STEM class. At C++ camp, I once again found myself to be the only girl, sleeping alone on a separate floor. Through the years, it has not been hard to notice that men have filled my classes, served as my CS role models, and attempted to overshadow my ideas and accomplishments. I have learned not to let the fact that I am the ‘only’ in a room dictate the role I choose to embody in it; even though no one else may share my gender, I will stand up for myself and demand equal respect from my peers. Even though I may be the only girl in a room, I now understand that I provide a unique and incredibly needed perspective. I’ve come a long way since coding camp, but I want to do everything I can to make STEM as positive of an environment as possible for the next generation of girls who want to design, innovate, and just generally do some really cool stuff.” -Lily

          <p>In my eighth grade robotics class, I was the only girl in the room, but that did not bother me. As I continued my academic career through high school, and now college, I became more aware of the stigmas and stereotypes towards women pursuing a career in STEM. It can be so discouraging at times to be one of the only girls in a male dominated class. That environment can give off a negative vibe that pushes you out the door and says, ‘you don’t belong here.’ Because of this, I have found myself thinking at times that I am not smart enough or capable enough to keep up with my male counterparts. However, I have abandoned that thought process to engage in a growth mindset to empower myself and other women in the STEM field.  In a female-driven space, you are able to put your guard down and focus on learning, growing, and creating your own path in STEM.  I felt like it was essential to provide resources for women interested in STEM to know what’s out there- unencumbered by social stigmas and stereotypes. Additionally, I feel like it is vital to support educating people on endorsing equality while they are young, so the next generation can progress more in the future. - Alexa
