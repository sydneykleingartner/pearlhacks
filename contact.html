            “I had never met a female engineer or computer scientist before walking onto my college’s campus. Since I had never known one, I doubted my ability to be one and felt like the odds were stacked against me. Through a lot of late nights and a few tears, I now know myself to be capable of whatever I put my mind to, and I understand the value of persistence, even when difficulties arise. Being a woman in computer science is difficult, but I know that with STEM, I have an amazing opportunity to move the world towards how I envision it to be.” -Sydney

          <p>In my eighth grade robotics class, I was the only girl in the room, but that did not bother me. As I continued my academic career through high school, and now college, I became more aware of the stigmas and stereotypes towards women pursuing a career in STEM. It can be so discouraging at times to be one of the only girls in a male dominated class. That environment can give off a negative vibe that pushes you out the door and says, ‘you don’t belong here.’ Because of this, I have found myself thinking at times that I am not smart enough or capable enough to keep up with my male counterparts. However, I have abandoned that thought process to engage in a growth mindset to empower myself and other women in the STEM field.  In a female-driven space, you are able to put your guard down and focus on learning, growing, and creating your own path in STEM.  I felt like it was essential to provide resources for women interested in STEM to know what’s out there- unencumbered by social stigmas and stereotypes. Additionally, I feel like it is vital to support educating people on endorsing equality while they are young, so the next generation can progress more in the future.
