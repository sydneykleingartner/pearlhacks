main topic: female empowerment
"a woman with a voice is by definition a strong woman" -melinda gates

ideas:
  - problem: high school girls not knowing what older women in STEM are doing
        - the user would provide a list of career fields they are interested in
        - when a woman does something awesome in that field, the user would get a text alert
        

what we want to do:
  - web page
      - use Bandwidth API for messaging
      - use a form to gather the information
