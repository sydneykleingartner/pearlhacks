main topic: female empowerment

team name ideas/quotes for inspiration:
"A woman with a voice is by definition a strong woman" -Melinda Gates
"It took me quite a long time to deveop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent." -Madeline Albright
"We need to encourage girls that their voice matters. I think that there are hundreds of thousands of Malalas out there" - Malala Yousafzai

problem idea:
  - high school girls not knowing what women in STEM fields are doing / what options they have available to them
        - the user would provide a list of career fields they are interested in
        - when a woman does something awesome in that field, the user would get a text alert

OVERALL- what we want to do:
  - web page 
      - free domain -> figure out later
      - pages: home, about us/mission statement, contact
      - content: careers, news, alerts
      - use Bandwidth API for messaging
      - use a form to gather the information for those who want to recieve text notifications
      - search for STEM fields (or options)
            - purpose would be to provide basic level of info about each field within STEM
            - page about a bunch of different topics within STEM (computer science, electrical engineering, etc)
            - embed Twitter feed for CS, etc.
            - YouTube videos
      - web scraping for recent news articles
      
CAREERS:
  - fields:
    - computer science
    - systems engineering
    - civil engineering
    - mechanical engineering
    - electrical & computer engineering
    - biomedical engineering
