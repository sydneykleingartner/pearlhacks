main topic: female empowerment

team name ideas/quotes for inspiration:
"A woman with a voice is by definition a strong woman" -Melinda Gates
"It took me quite a long time to deveop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent." -Madeline Albright
"We need to encourage girls that their voice matters. I think that there are hundreds of thousands of Malalas out there" - Malala Yousafzai

ideas:
  - problem: high school girls not knowing what older women in STEM are doing
        - the user would provide a list of career fields they are interested in
        - when a woman does something awesome in that field, the user would get a text alert
        

what we want to do:
  - web page
      - use Bandwidth API for messaging
      - use a form to gather the information
